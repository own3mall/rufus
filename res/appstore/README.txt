This directory contains the resources to create a Windows Store package.

However, since Microsoft doesn't allow elevated applications into the Windows
Store, and, even if you install it manually, Windows 10 will also refuse to
elevate it (so you have to explicitly select to run it as admin *every time*),
this is rather pointless.

Still, you can find the latest signed application package at:
